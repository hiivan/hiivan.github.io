All my life, I face with the frustration of a short-term memory. I would easily forget things I have just read or learnt two minutes ago. Just like trying to capture snowflakes in the air, many of your ideas often melt away into non-existence. Most of what I consume do not stay permanent in my memory. That is the fleetingness of life.

## Active Recall, Spaced Repetition and Second Brain

When I was a student in junior college studying for 'A' Levels, the content we were learning were becoming more and more complex. So I started searching up study techniques to optimize my learning. I came across [Ali Abdaal's YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE) on _Active Recall_ and _Spaced Repetition_. These were super legit, scientifically backed advice, as opposed to the plethora of "Top 101 Study Tips" listicles online that sounds good but doesn't work.

(Spoiler alert: Just because you feel good after reading a text over and over again for 10 times or blindly copying down notes, doesn't mean you actually retain the information in your brain.)

<p class="definition"><strong>Active Recall</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>:
<em>This involves retrieving information from your brain after learning something, typically through testing yourself. The act of recalling strengthens your ability to retain your information and solidifies the connections in our brain between different concepts.</em>
<br><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>: <em>The act of reviewing materials at spaced intervals. This is effective in memory retention and fights the forgetting curve.</em></p>

I then got exposed to the idea of [Building a Second Brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) by Tiago Forte.

It essentially is building an external personal knowledge system where you deposit all your thoughts and learnings there. Information overload is a plague of today's society, and building a virtual brain can help to lighten the load off your already overloaded memory, giving us the space for your brain CPU to focus on actualizing these ideas.

## Note-Taking App: Roam Research

_(This segment talks about my experience with Roam Research, a note-taking app. If you are not interested in that, you may [skip to the next segment] of the article.)_

Not too long after reading about The Second Brain, I discovered [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and have been using it ever since.

What makes Roam different from the rest of the other note-taking apps?

Note-taking apps typically function hierarchically. You create categories, and within each categories are sub-categories and within them contain notes. The problem with this is that we face the issue of deciding where to put these notes under, since they can belong to multiple categories.

Roam Research is a note-taking application for networked thought. It seeks to make note-taking function more like how a brain processes information. Whenever you have an idea, your brain will create multiple associations to it. Thinking of linked concepts will help you recall that idea.

Likewise, Roam seeks to associate notes with other notes via bi-directional linking, making it easier to connect your ideas. It becomes your second brain. Your notes do not just sit there idly like other note apps. Roam encourages serendipity by letting you to continuously revisit past notes.

For those tinkerers out there, you can even create your own custom CSS or JavaScript themes. You can check out my theme [CyanoRoam](https://github.com/hiivan/CyanoRoam) on Github. If you are interested to know more about Roam Research, you can also check out [Ali Abdaal's video on Roam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpikCLhpIRY).

## How I Take Notes

Before I continue, I think many of you may wonder:
<p class="example">Why are you taking notes? Are you studying?</p>

Oftentimes, when people think of taking notes, they associate it to studying for an exam. But the fact is, we are constantly learning new things everyday. So if you are all about living life to the fullest and improving yourself as a person, then why would you not transfer this concept of note-taking to your own personal life?

One of the best thing writing can do for you is to __sharpen your thinking__. Sitting down and putting the work to synthesizing your thoughts can help to produce better quality ideas. I personally write my own essays for my personal development too. If I find myself having an abstract thought in my head that it is hard to express in words, penning them down can help to solidify and refine the idea.

### üì∏Quick Capture

Our brains are constantly coming up with new ideas. Sometimes, this can get very distracting and take away from what we are currently focusing on. A way I have come up to curb that is that whenever I come up with a new idea or inspiration, I will immediately capture them down on my notes app (commonly known as _Quick Capture_).

I keep quotes, reading highlights, podcast insights and everything you can think of. I find this very liberating as it helps to take the load off my brain so I can focus what is important presently. Then, at the end of the day, I can go back to review whatever I have written the entire day, and decide whether I will add them to the list of stuff to work on.

### üìöBook/Podcast/Article Summaries

I try my best to paraphrase and summarize every book I read, or other content I consume online e.g. podcasts, articles. Especially when coming across a foreign concept that I wish to learn more on, I find that this is the best way to actively engage and retain information I have gained from my readings.

Take note (pun intended): When taking notes, paraphrase and try not to refer back to the material at hand. This is the essence behind the _Active Recall_ technique.

### ‚öñÔ∏èQuantifying My Productivity

I subscribe to the notion of the **1% Rule**: if you improve yourself by 1% everyday for one year, you will end up 380% better than where you started off a year ago. I first read this from the author of [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits), James Clear.

Of course, in reality, the metric to quantify your productivity is little bit more unclear, and you might not exactly be 3.8x better. But the 1% Rule proves how powerful compound interest can be and how it can do wonders to your life.

I follow a simple system of quantifying my output to track my productivity. I have a section called <span class="green-button">‚è≥Timeline of My Life</span>, where I record down notable things that I have learnt or done today or when I achieved a certain milestone in my life.

This is especially useful if you wish to do weekly reviews on your personal development. Looking at all your past notes can give you a birds-eye view of what you have accomplished the entire week. By reviewing, you are also applying *Spaced Repetition* to your learning. On an unrelated note, occasionally looking back at the mini-achievements you have done can do wonders to your motivation and self-esteem :P.

I am considering using a software tool like [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) in the future to relegate this mini-project to. Maybe one day, I will reach the level of [julian.digital](https://julian.digital/2020/02/23/my-quantified-self-setup/).

### üìùJournaling

As mentioned in my article on journaling, I also use Roam as a tool for writing down my thoughts and reflections. You can read the article [here](https://www.ivan-ang.com/journaling-as-a-tool-for-self-help), where I talk more about how I use it to manage my emotional and mental health.

## Conclusion

So this is a brief overview of the theories behind how I do my note-taking. I hope you have gained some insights after reading this post, and perhaps even incorporate some of these concepts into your own life!
